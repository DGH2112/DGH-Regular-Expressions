Description

This application was originally designed as a test-bed for creating complex regular expressions
to parse C++ grammar. Unfortunately that venture failed due to the gramar being to complex and
creating regular expressions that exceeded a limit at circa 32,000 character however I thought
that this application might help others create and test regular expressions against files.

Please refer to the web page above for hepl on using the application.

In order to compile the software yourself you will need the following components:
 * Virtual Treeview;
 * SynEdit.
